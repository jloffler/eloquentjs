/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

const size = 8;
let row = 0;
let outPut = "";

while (row < size) {
  for (let n = 0; n < size; n++) {
    if ((row + n)%2 == 0) {
      outPut += '_';
    } else { 
      outPut += '#';
    }
  }
  row++;
  if (row < size) outPut += "\n";
}
console.log(outPut);
